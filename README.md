Our Push Api receiver nodejs code

To create a Node.js server that receives JSON data in the POST request body, you can use the express module along with the body-parser middleware. Here's an example:

First, make sure you have installed express and body-parser by running the following command in your project folder:
npm install express body-parser

Next, create a Node.js script to set up the server and handle the JSON POST request: index.js

You can run this example on server by sending a POST request to https://yourdomain.come/api/data with JSON data in the request body. For example, you can use tools like curl, Postman, or libraries like axios to send the POST request. Please make sure you enable the post request from our server IP or make it public.

When the server receives the JSON data, it will log it and respond with a JSON message confirming that the data was received successfully.
